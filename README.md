# Basic classification: Classify images of clothing 

The python code in this repo was adapted from jupyter notebook at:
https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/keras/classification.ipynb

and described in this online tutorial:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

This guide trains a neural network model to classify images of clothing, like sneakers and shirts. It's okay if you don't understand all the details; this is a fast-paced overview of a complete TensorFlow program with the details explained as you go.

This guide uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow.

The matplotlib package is used to display images and graphs.

The nbconvert utility is used to help convert the jupyter notebook into a python script.
